Project Proposal
Team 03

Part A

     The goal of our project is to use graph and data to show the cellular data subscriptions of different 
countries in different years. We want to put several countries in one graph and display the subscriptions 
in each year. The user is able to compare the data between each country and also know the increasing or 
decreasing trend of the country. Our project consists of two panels. One is called GraphView which stores
the country data and another is called Legend which shows corresponding color and country name graphed in 
the GraphView Panel. The paintComponent() method in each class add the components to the panel.

     Based on the last assignment, we are planning to add two features to make our project more user friendly.
1) Hover Over : First, we will try to add MouseHoverOverData.java class. When the mouse hover over the data 
   point in the graph, the user could see the label of the subscription in that year. Second, we will also 
   try to add MouseHoverOverCountry.java class. When the mouse hover over the country in LegendPanel, the user
   could see the label of all the subscription year for that country. 
3) Compare data by Click: we will try to compare the data of two countries using CompareTwoCountry.java.
   When the users click the two countries they want to compare, the graph will show the data of two countries.
